# Android Native

A basic template project for people that want skip Java or Kotlin as must as possible.

There is a build by Gradle but is to have a easily integration with NDK and CMake. It takes seconds or milliseconds because don't have to download dependencies or compile Java/Kotlin code.

> Yes, I know that even a hello world Gradle project is fast. But until you finish the first sync it will take minutes 🙆‍♂️. 

But there is a script if you want to avoid Gradle. Manual script don't requires you have a folder structure as used by default Gradle Android projects.
