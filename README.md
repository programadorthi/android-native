# Android Native with CLAY

Clay (short for C Layout) is a high performance 2D UI layout library.

Checkout the official [site](https://www.nicbarker.com/clay) or [repository](https://github.com/nicbarker/clay) for more info and demos.

## Features

> Clay draw nothing. It has abstraction only. You need something to draw the components as a canvas. Here I'm using LVGL Canvas.

- [ ] Draw rectangles using LVGL canvas rect (in progress)
- [ ] Text measure using LVGL Text (in progress)
- [ ] Text rendering using LVGL canvas label
- [ ] Image rendering using LVGL canvas
- [ ] Border rendering using LVGL canvas
- [ ] Screen rotation with state restoration
